## Tasks
---
### Task 0
* Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:
	* Prototype: `def read_file(filename=""):`
	* You must use the `with` statement
	* You don't need to manage `file permission` or `file does't exists` exceptions
	* You are not allowed to import any module

### Task 1
* Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written:
	* Prototype: `def write_file(filename="", text="")`
	* You must use the `with` statement
	* You don’t need to manage file permission exceptions.
	* Your function should create the file if doesn’t exist.
	* Your function should overwrite the content of the file if it already exists.
	* You are not allowed to import any module

### Task 2
* Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added:
	* Prototype: `def append_write(filename="", text=""):`
	* If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created
	* You must use the `with` statement
	* You don’t need to manage `file permission` or `file doesn't exist` exceptions.
	* You are not allowed to import any module

### Task 3
* Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string):
	* Prototype: `def to_json_string(my_obj):`
	* You don’t need to manage exceptions if the object can’t be serialized.
