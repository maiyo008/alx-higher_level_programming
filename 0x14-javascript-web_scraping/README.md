```
$ sudo npm install request --global
$ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules
```
**Notes:** Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).
