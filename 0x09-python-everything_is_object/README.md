# 0x09. Python - Everything is object
---
## Objectives
---
* What is an object
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is the difference between immutable and mutable  object
* What is a refference
* What is an assignment
* What is an alias
* How to know if two variables are identical
* How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* How to display the variable identifier(memory address in Cpython implementation)
* What is mutable and immutable
* What are the built-in mutable types
* What are the built-in immutable  types
* How does python pass variables to  functions
